To satisfy the upload size requirements, one of the core libraries used in this program has been excluded.
To download this library go here: https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/ and use the download button.
Once downloaded, extract and add the following files, if they are not there, to this projects lib folder:
ejml-xxx.jar
stanford-core-nlp-xxx.jar
stanford-core-nlp-xxx-models.jar
Where xxx is the version number. Once you've added these to the lib folder, right click on the project and go to
properties. Once in properties navigate to Java Build Path, go to the libraries tab and click on add jars. Select
whichever of the above libraries that weren't there and add them.

Once all this is complete the code should work properly.

Make sure you use a search term that is fairly niche and unique since the free version of this api doesn't allow that
many lookups. I suggest using "leona"
